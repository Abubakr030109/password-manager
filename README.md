# Password Manager
A terminal based Password Manager thats built using Python. This password manager allows you to specify the:
* Password Length
* Number of Uppercase Characters
* Number of Digits
* Number of Special Characters

This specifications are part the 'Advanced mode'. The 'Defualt Mode' provides some sensible defualts for your convenience.

## Encrypted Files
My password manager uses a very basic encryption algorithm to encrypt all the data recieved (passwords, services that each password is for, and the master password).

## Starting Values
By defualt, the master password is "MasterPass1", and the 'My_Passwords.txt' file will have 3 services in it, namely:
* Service1
* Service2
* Service3

All of these values can be changed or deleted via this password manager.
